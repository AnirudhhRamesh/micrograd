I started coding the project in ~July, without rewatching the lecture in order to properly test my understanding and go through the reasoning steps myself, since I had mostly forgotten all the actual implementation details.
    Most of the intuition behind building this was from the ML Specialization, but also some calc stuff I did from high-school/uni.

    On a further note, once I had a working micrograd, I faced some problems with getting increasing loss during the training steps. After trying to debug a couple evenings after work, manually computing the backprop and not figuring out why it was increasing, I decided to look through Karpathy's [codebase](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) to debug faster (as my primary objective for the project was to solidify my ML understanding which I accomplished by building a working version).

    In high school, we solved closed-form solutions by hand (i.e. where an absolute solution exists). This works fine for two or three points.

    But as the complexity increases, it becomes very hard to find a closed form solution. E.g. how do you find each m when we have more features like y = m1*x1 + m2*x1 + m3*x1 + b?

    This is why we try to approximately fit the line.
    To do this, we need to have a measure of 'how well does our line fit the points', so that we can continually try to bring this measure to zero ('optimize this').

    We can basically use the metric of 'how far apart are the points from my line?'.

    3. We'll sum these square differences over all the points we have to get the total loss
    4. We take the mean over the total data points (so that adding more data samples does not drastically change our metric). 

    This basically describes the loss, in this case using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) function and my understanding of it. And this will be our measure of 'how far apart are my points'.

    A more efficient way (which avoids computing every possible value of the parameters), would be to look at the change in the loss with respect to m and b.

    As a reminder, we are trying to find the m which results in the lowest loss.
    Let's say currently we are at m=2, the loss is approximately 10.
    By taking the partial derivative of the loss with respect to m, we are basically asking 'how does the loss change when m changes.
    For a given point, we can use the formula for the limit/derivative:
    f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}

    This tells us that if we take a very small h e.g. 0.001, and we compute the loss w.r.t to m=2, we get that the (f(2.001) - f(2)) / 0.001 = (9.999 - 10) / 0.001 = (-0.001) / 0.001 = -1 (very rough calc)

    What does this -1 means? It means that if we increase m by 1, then the loss will increase by -1.

    This is indeed the direction we want to go in (we want the loss to decrease), thus we can take a step in this direction.

    So m = m - dL/dm (subtract by a negative value, thus we are adding, so m increases which means loss decreases)

    Now if we do the same thing for m=8, we see the dL/dm is approximately 1. So it means if m increases by 1, then the loss increases by 1. We want to reduce the loss, thus we want to decrease m (which decreases loss). Conveniently, our previous function handles this correctly.

    So m = m - dL/dm (subtract by a positive value, thus m decreases thus loss decreases)

    This formula is our 'optimization step'. We can improve it further by adding a hyperparameter epsilon which tells us how big optimization steps to make (if we take too big steps, we could jump across the minima. If we take too small steps, we could converge at a local minima or take too long to train):
    m := m - \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial m}

    Eventually, we'll get to a point where the loss barely changes when we change m, which is the minimum of the loss (it is where the loss is changing from positive to negative, and thus the change in the loss in the lowest (and equal to 0)). This would be where our loss is at its lowest.

    If we take a 2nd derivative of the loss w.r.t to w, this would be a straight line which is at y=0 when the change in loss is zero, and thus parameter m is 'optimal'.

    This basically is how gradient descent works and the foundation on top of which ML is built on.

    We can expand this to further dimensions easily, as it's just a matter of taking the partial derivatives w.r.t. all the parameters/dimensions we have.

    st.header("Logistic regression (classifier)")

    st.write("""
    For classification (e.g. classify an image as hot-dog or not), we use the logistic regression function, as we want to predict discrete values such as 1, 0 rather than continuous values that linear regression predicts such as 1.3232 or -12.42

    Logistic regression works in mostly the same way as linear regression. Except that, with logistic regression we'll want to define the binary cross entropy loss instead of the MSE loss.

    We construct this in a way that our loss increases when our prediction is incorrect, and our loss does not change when our prediction is indeed correct. Eventually, if all our predictions are correct, then our loss would not change thus it will be zero.

    The binary cross entropy loss is basically the following:
    binary cross entropy cost = -y * log (y^) -(1-y) * log ( 1-y^)

    Just like the MSE, I love this function because it's actually very intuitive: 
    - The log function tells us what exponent we need to raise our base to get the value. So e.g. log2(8) = 3, because we need to raise 2 (base) to 3 (exponent) to get 8 (value). 2^3 = 8.
    - The log of 1 is equal to zero (e.g. log2(1) = 0). So for correct predictions, we want the value inside the log to be as close as possible to 1.
    - The log of (close to) 0 approaches minus infinity (e.g. log2(0.5)=-1, log2(0.25) = -2). For an incorrect prediction, we want the value inside the log to be close to zero (so that the loss increases).

    Note: As you can see for incorrect guesses (i.e. less than 1), the log function outputs a negative value), thus we need to negate the logs in our function (which is why it's -log).
    Note: We multiply the logs by y and (1-y) because this serves as a 'switch'. If y = 1, we ignore the loss for y=0 (because 1 - y=1 = 0, which cancels the second part of the equation).

    Note: As you might have noticed, since we're using logs, we need to ensure that our predictions are capped between 0 and 1. log(0) or negative does not exist. In order to do this (and also to better fit our data points), we'll have to use a sigmoid cost function (instead of the simple linear cost function of y= m*x + c).

    The sigmoid function as as follows:

    y^ = 1 / 1 + (e^-(mx + b))

    This is also intuitive:
    - When the exponent component is negative, then our prediction is 1/(1 + huge) = 0
    - When the exponent component is 0, then our prediction is 1/(1+1) = 0.5
    - When the exponent component is positive, then our prediction is 1/(1 + small) = 1

    So the beauty of autograd/auto-diff (automatic differentiation) is that it efficiently computes the partial derivatives w.r.t. the loss.

    Computing the partial derivative of each parameter with respect to the loss would be O(n^2) complexity. With autograd, we are able to do this in one-pass in O(n) complexity.

    The naive, inefficient way would be to compute the partial derivative with respect to the loss for each parameter, which would be O(n^2), where n is the # of parameters.

    The auto-grad, more efficient way would be do a so-called 'forward-pass' (inference) which passes forwards the values, then a 'backwards-pass' which pass back the partial derivatives.

    In the forward pass, we very simply chain together multiplications that lead to the function we have defined (e.g. y^ = m * x + b)
    In the backward pass, we recursively applying the chain rule from differentiation.

    Refresh on the chain rule:
    dy/dx = du/dx * dy/u

    What the chain rule states is that the change in loss with respect to x is equal to the change in loss with respect to an intermediate variable u * the change in u with respect to x.

    This means we can go back from the loss, and at each previous node we can apply the chain rule to get the partial derivative of that node with respect to the loss. As a result, computing the partial derivatives now only takes O(n)!

    Once the back prop is complete, all our parameters now have their partial derivatives with respect to the loss.

    Thus we can apply the optimization step (which is basically updating the parameters by subtracting the partial derivatives).

    When we do an addition (e.g. c = a + b), y is the child of x and b. When we do backprop, from the c node we can compute the partial derivatives of a and b using chain rule. From this, a would be equal to the derivative of loss w.r.t to c, b would also be equal to the derivative of loss w.r.t to c. This is because in c = a + b, when icreasing a by 1, c will also increase by 1. 
    When we do a multiplication (e.g. c = a * b), c is the child of an and b. When we do backprop, from the c node we can compute the partial derivatives of a and b using chain rule. From this, a would be equal to b * partial derivative of c. b would be equal to a * partial derivative of c. This is because in c = a * b, when we take the derivative, we are left with dc/da = b. Thus when a increases by 1, c increases by 1*b times.

    We then add support to several other operations such division, exponent (needed for sigmoid function), power (needed for MSE loss).

However, when using a smaller learning rate, the training simply took too long and kept getting stuck in local minima (around 1.2-1.3).

    To resolve this, I attempted a very naive solution of adjusted the learning rate at different thresholds (so decreasing the learning rate as it got closer, because the steps were increasing). This still did not work, as you can see the loss was bouncing (and if I picked something very small it would again get stuck in local minima).

    I tried adding stochastic gradient descent (which only updates a random subset of the weights, and supposedly reduces the chance of getting stuck in local minima), but I ended up scrapping this because it increased the learning rate.
